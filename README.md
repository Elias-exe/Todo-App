- Where can I see your demo?

https://todo-app-b7d92.web.app

- What was your experience?

Another challenge with a simple proposal, but that receives several elements from real projects, the part that I felt the most difficulty was when it came to arranging a structure for the project, after studying it for a while I found that the best situation would be to use the useContext , after that the project became much simpler

- What have you learned/improved?
useContext

- Your wisdom? :)


Study the project a lot before starting to execute it.
